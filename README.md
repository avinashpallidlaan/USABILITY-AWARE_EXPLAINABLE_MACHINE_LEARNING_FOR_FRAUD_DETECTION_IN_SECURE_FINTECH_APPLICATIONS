 Overview

This project proposes an explainable AI (XAI) framework that classifies user app reviews from fintech platforms (PayPal, Google Pay, PhonePe) into:
-  Positive Feedback  
-  Fraud Complaints  
- Usability Issues  

It also forecasts usability and fraud trends using LSTM and Prophet.



Key Components

- TF-IDF + Logistic Regression: For text classification  
- LIME & SHAP: For interpretability and explainability  
- LSTM Forecasting: To predict complaint trends  
- Preprocessing pipeline: For cleaning raw app reviews
